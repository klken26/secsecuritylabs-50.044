Exercise 1
We just need to find functions that involves buffers / pointers or even
accesses the memory address of a variable.
zookd.c seems like a daemon handler, which will fork() whenever there is
a new client to handle their requests. Most of the variables are either 
declared as static or const; Hence they are either not in the stack nor not 
modifiable during runtime. 
However, zookd.c runs on functions from http.c and there is a vulnerability
that can be exploited. As zook handles client HTTP requests and the urls
are encoded for security, the url_decode() function in http.c decodes them
to be used in the the http_request_headers() and http_request_line() 
functions.
So, being able to exploit the url_decode() function would have a huge
impact on zook.
